## Data exploration:

### # of observations

There are 7806 rows in our all_diets file, which means we have a total of 7806 observations on different diets. We have six total features: diet type, recipe name, cuisine, protein, carbs, and fats. Our target feature is the diet type, and the main independent features are protein, carb, fats, and cuisine.

For cuisine types, there are a bunch of categories we account for: ['american' 'south east asian' 'mexican' 'chinese' 'mediterranean'
'italian' 'french' 'indian' 'nordic' 'eastern europe' 'central europe'
'kosher' 'british' 'caribbean' 'south american' 'middle eastern' 'asian'
'japanese' 'world'].
The diet types are our main target feature and there are five classes: ['paleo' 'vegan' 'keto' 'mediterranean' 'dash'].
The rest of the features are numbers and are no discrete.

### data distribution

There are 1522 obersavtions for vegan, 1274 observations for paleo, 1753 observations for mediterranean, 1512 observations for keto, 1745 observations for dash

### Scale

Our two categoriacal classes: diet type and cuisine, just have their own distinct categories for classification.

For protein, fat, and carb, the means are pretty different: 83.23, 117.33, and 152.12 respectively. Furthermore, the stds are also very different: 89.8, 122.1, and 185.91 respectively. This indicates the distribution of data to be very different. Furthermore, the ranges are different too: [0, 1273], [0, 1930.24], and [0.6, 3405.55]. All these indicate that we need to normalize the data.

### Other parts of the dataset

There are no missing data and null values. There are three features that we are considering dropping, which are cuisine name, extraction date, and time because they don't seem to be that impactful on our overall outcome.
